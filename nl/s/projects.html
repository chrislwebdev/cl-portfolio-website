                    In Wales, New Leaf has been actively involved in the
                    preservation and enhancement of Snowdonia National Park, the

                <p class="main__paragraph">
                  Snowdonia National Park is a breathtaking expanse of
                  mountains, valleys, and lakes, home to Wales' highest
                  mountain, Snowdon. New Leaf has played a crucial role in
                  restoring ancient woodland and creating new habitats for
                  wildlife by planting over 50,000 trees in the park. This
                  dedication to reforestation has not only revitalized the
                  natural beauty of the area but also contributed to the park's
                  resilience against climate change

                <p class="main__paragraph">
                  New Leaf is committed to expanding its efforts in Wales and
                  has set its sights on Brecon Beacons National Park, another
                  gem of the Welsh landscape. With its rolling hills, tranquil
                  valleys, and rich biodiversity, it is a natural choice for the
                  charity's next phase of conservation work. By planting trees
                  in this park, New Leaf aims to further protect the Welsh
                  countryside and strengthen its ecological integrity.
