                The Scots pine is a coniferous tree that is native to Eurasia.
                It is one of the most common tree species in Europe and is found
                in a variety of habitats, from boreal forests to mountain
                slopes. Scots pines are known for their straight trunks,
                orange-red bark, and blue-green needles. They provide food and
                shelter for a variety of wildlife; help to protect biodiversity
                by providing habitats for many different plant and animal
                species; play a role in regulating the climate by absorbing
                carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

                The rowan tree is a deciduous tree that is native to Europe and
                Asia. It is known for its clusters of bright red berries, which
                are a popular food source for birds. The rowan tree also has a
                number of environmental benefits, including helps to improve air
                quality by absorbing pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide and
                ozone; helping to reduce soil erosion by its roots holding the
                soil in place; helps to regulate the water cycle by absorbing
                rainwater and releasing it slowly into the groundwater system

              <p class="main__paragraph">
                The yew tree is a long-lived coniferous tree that is native to
                Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is known for its dark green,
                needle-like leaves and its red berries. The yew tree also has a
                number of environmental benefits, including being a very
                slow-growing tree, which means that it stores a lot of carbon in
                its wood; a very shade-tolerant tree, which means that it can
                grow in dense forests; a very hardy tree, which means that it
                can tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions
