              Forests cover about one-third of the Earth's land surface and play
              a vital role in our planet's health. They are often called the
              "lungs of the Earth" because they absorb carbon dioxide from the
              atmosphere and release oxygen, which we need to breathe. Forests
              also provide many other important benefits, including:
            </p>

            <ul class="earth-forests-list">
              <li>
                • Regulating the climate: Forests help to regulate the Earth's
                climate by absorbing carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that
                contributes to global warming. They also help to release water
                vapor into the atmosphere, which helps to create clouds and
                bring rain.
              </li>
              <li>
                • Protecting biodiversity: Forests are home to a vast array of
                plant and animal life. Over half of the world's known land-based
                plant and animal species live in forests. Forests provide these
                species with essential habitats, food, and water.
              </li>
              <li>
                • Preventing erosion and flooding: Forest roots help to hold
                soil in place, preventing erosion and landslides. Forests also
                help to absorb rainwater, reducing the risk of flooding.
              </li>
              <li>
                • Providing clean air and water: Forests filter pollutants from
                the air and water, providing us with clean air to breathe and
                clean water to drink.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="main__paragraph">
              Forests are not only important for the planet's health, but they
              are also essential for our own well-being. Forests provide us with
              a variety of goods and services, including:
            </p>

            <ul class="earth-forests-list">
              <li>
                • Timber and other forest products: Forests provide us with
                timber, paper, and other forest products that we use in our
                everyday lives.
              </li>

              <li>
                • Food and medicine: Forests provide us with a variety of food
                and medicinal plants.
              </li>

              <li>
                • Recreation and tourism: Forests are popular destinations for
                recreation and tourism. People enjoy hiking, camping, fishing,
                and other activities in forests.
              </li>

              <li>
                • Spiritual and cultural value: Forests have important spiritual
                and cultural value for many people around the world.
              </li>
            </ul>

              Forests are essential for the health of our planet and our
              well-being. We must protect our forests for future generations.
